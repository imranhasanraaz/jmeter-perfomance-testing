200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 2.7 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1000.
300 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 4.4 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1500.
400 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 8 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2000.


While executed 400 concurrent request, found  7 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.35%.

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 300 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
